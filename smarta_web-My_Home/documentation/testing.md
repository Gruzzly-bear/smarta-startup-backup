# Checklist

* For every file worked on, you must create your own unit tests!
  * Create a folder under: *smarta_web\smarta\src\\_\_tests\_\_* with the name of your page
  * Within this folder, store all tests related to your page
  * Testing file extension: \<name\>.test.js
* All tests go under the following folder: *smarta_web\smarta\src\\_\_tests\_\_*
* **NEVER** commit any code which doesn't pass its associated tests! 
<br></br>

# About Jest
* Every time *npm test* is run, Jest only runs tests related to files changed since the last commit
* For an example to see how testing works in Jest, refer to: *smarta_web\smarta\src\\_\_tests\_\_\JestTutorial.test.js*
